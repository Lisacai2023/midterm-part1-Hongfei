# Programming - Object Oriented Programming - Midterm - Part 1

Hello my ProCrammers!

This is part one of our midterm. Here you will walk through a step by step process for making a small application that connects to a **Database**. 

Along the way you learn how to use static classes and methods, inheritance, override, virtual, and other oop concepts.

There are questions during the tutorial that you need to answer. All your final answers must be placed on the [Questions](Questions.md) sheet located in the Solution.

You must also complete the whole assignment. Since Part 2 will have you create your own form of application with a **Database** and classes that exhibit the 3 pillars of objects oriented programming.

Along the way if you run into any issues, feel free to reach out, and I'll be happy to help. But follow the steps closely and you'll be fine. Absorb what's happening and ask questions. 

Cheers,
Will
